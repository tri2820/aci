check bash requirements on 'install_this'

make a "load" function, which receives project.zip and uncompress, install libs for it
    aka reverse distribute

read setup on startup
    write data like FQBN and PORT to yml file for fast startup

Note:
#libs -> LOCATION
#sketchbook == /root/Arduino/libraries/
#arduino:avr@1.6.23 == /home/tri/.arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/avr/1.6.23/libraries
